durations...

- `-sample-width=N` (*int*): Number of bytes that your sounds must have.
- `-frame-rate=N` (*int*): Sampling frequency that your sounds must have.
- `-nframes=N` (*int*): Exact number of frames that your sounds must have.

### **`dev-extras-required`**

> - Doesn't support `setup.py` files. Please, [migrate your setup configuration
 to `setup.cfg` format][setup-py-upgrade-link].
> - Support for `pyproject.toml` files is limited to printing errors, automatic
 file rewriting is not performed.

Check if your development dependencies contains all other extras requirements.
If an extra requirement is defined in other extra group than your development
one, it will be added to your development extra dependencies group. If your
development group is not defined, it will be created.

This is useful if you want to execute `python -m pip install -e .[dev]` to
install all the optional requirements of the package, so if you add new
requirements to other groups, it would be added to development requirements.

#### Parameters

- `-extra=NAME` (*str*): Name for your development requirements extra group
 (as default `dev`).
- `-setup-cfg=PATH` (*str*): Path to your `setup.cfg` file, mandatory if
 the extras requirements are defined in a `setup.cfg` file and this is located
 in another directory than the current one.
- `-pyproject-toml=PATH` (*str*): Path to your `pyproject.toml` file,
 mandatory if the extras requirements are defined in a `pyproject.toml` file
 and this is located in another directory than the current one.
